# tic-tac-mess

My first big program. Don't judge, I am still smol baby coder.

First file was my first attempt. It worked fine, but was big and ugly. Uploaded second file instead of committing a change since it was such a big change.
Second version is way cleaner, and I'm trying to get in the habit of PEP8 formatting. It's probably the final version, since I'm coming up on the next
milestone project in my course.
